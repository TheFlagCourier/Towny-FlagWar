## About Flag War

Flag War is a Towny Advanced project, and was formerly included within the main plugin. (It still is, at present.)

It was originally coded by [Chris Holland](https://github.com/Zren) (AKA: [Shade](https://bukkit.org/members/shade.526/)),
with minor modifications over the years by the various Towny maintainers and contributors.


## About this repository
This repository is a work-in-progress repo, where I can get work done. Once a runnable plugin is buildable, the repo
will be moved into the TownyAdvanced group, and a PR submitted to remove Flag War's legacy code from Towny proper.

## License and Redistribution
Towny, and by extension Flag War, is licensed in a way preventing redistribution of binaries. Until this is commited upstream, no binaries will be offered.
